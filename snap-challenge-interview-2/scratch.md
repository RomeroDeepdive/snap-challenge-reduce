1. In pseudocode, write a function that takes a string and returns it with all vowels (not including y) removed.
2. In pseudocode, write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the greatest number in the array.
3. In pseudocode, write a function that computes the first 100 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence
 is created by adding the two previous numbers in the sequence together, and starts 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...
 
 
declare a function of getVowels [A, E, I, O, U]
var Vowels = 0
for var of I to equal 0. loop through the string
i <= string.length -1
i++
if string charLetter (i) == "a", "e", "i", "o", "u"
return Vowels

declare  function greatestNUmber (arr)
declare the vaiable as var greatestNUmber = [0,0,0,0]
create a for loop for var arrayIndex = 0 arraryIndex <arr.length arraryIndex++
return greatestNumber (4,5,20,180,6,2,184,2000,412,1,5,8,7,9,6,3,4,1,2,0,2001)

_Carls example:_ 
declare the array
declare the function
declare how to sort the array
sort using declaring how to sort
call on the first item in the [0]


let n = fib
if n <= 0 return an empty []
if n == 1 return 0
result = [0,1]
if n == 2 return result


Marty example: 

I'm going to need ro set my intial value

we got two numbers that start the fib sequence as the same numbers. 1 and 1
let fib=[1,1] is an empty array
for i=1 to 99 sequences -- this will do this 100 times. The 1 starts us at the second sport of the array
fib[i]=fib[i-2] + fib[i-1] we grabbing the 2 prior numbers in the array and placing them in the current
